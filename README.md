# WellnessApp

I developed an Android App that allow coaches of high performance athletes to know the subjective state of the athlete after doing a training session.\n
The app validate the user using FireBase. It ask questions to the athletes that are upload into FireBase RealTime DataBase and finaly, the app download the 
information of the surveys and show the mean and desviation of the answers.\n
This allows coaches to map out a schedule of sports routines that best suits each athlete.
